# Student Performance Prediction

## Problem Statement
To analyze and predict student final exam marks based on study behavior and internal performance.

## Proposed System
A Machine Learning model that predicts final marks (G3) using study time, absences, G1 and G2 marks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- Kaggle Dataset

## Algorithm
Linear Regression

## Result
Mean Absolute Error: 1.31

The model predicts student performance with good accuracy.

## Future Scope
- Add more features like parental education
- Use advanced algorithms like Random Forest
- Develop a web-based interface
